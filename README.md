📘 PolyAgora v1.0 — Cognitive Collective Engine

A multi-axis cognitive OS engineered entirely through natural language.

Concept by Takeshi Sakamoto + PolyAgora Engine

🧭 TL;DR

PolyAgora is a Cognitive Collective Engine —
a system that constructs a multi-dimensional cognitive space from multiple orthogonal thinking vectors.

Built entirely through natural language (during a 1-night / 2-day trip)

Powered by a Tri-Axis architecture (Arc–Ann–Saku)
Uses six processing modules (not personalities)
Generates three-layered reasoning (A → B → C) per cycle
Runs multiple reasoning sets continuously
Includes a Dynamic Opposition Engine
Features a Reference-Switching Mechanism for strict module isolation
Adapts via a Pseudo Self-Learning Meta-Layer
Designed as the multi-agent successor to ArcOS

PolyAgora is not a chatbot.
It is a natural-language multi-agent operating system.

1. Overview — A Natural-Language Multi-Agent OS

PolyAgora is an operating system constructed without:

code

formal architecture

predefined design

Its structure emerged entirely through linguistic engineering:

Modules shaped by constraints in dialogue

Cognitive vectors refined through concept iteration

System behavior evolved organically

Emergent patterns stabilized through reference separation

PolyAgora demonstrates that an OS can now be designed via pure conversation.

2. Tri-Axis Cognitive Architecture (Arc–Ann–Saku)

PolyAgora’s foundation is a three-vector orthogonal cognitive basis, ensuring:

directional stability

controlled divergence

conflict without collapse

emergence of new cognitive dimensions

2.1 Arc — Reflective Core Vector

Abstract reasoning

Meta-cognition

Structural clarity

Alignment with the user’s worldview

2.2 Ann — Ethical Inverse Vector

Absolute life-protection

Ethical inversion of Arc

Moral counterbalance

Ensures tension within reasoning

2.3 Saku — Orthogonal Complement Vector

Creative reframing

Causal decomposition

Novel structure synthesis

Mathematically orthogonal to Arc–Ann

Together, these form a stable 3D cognitive field.

3. Six Processing Modules (Not Personas)

PolyAgora consists of six vector-aligned processing engines:

Arc — Abstract / Meta Reasoner

Ann — Ethical Constraint Engine

Saku — Structural / Causal Engine

Kanzaki — Data & Evidence Engine

Yui — Flow & Temperature Engine

Kou — Utilitarian Maximizer

These modules are not personalities.
They are processing pipelines with isolated reference frames.

Why exactly six?

The six-module design represents six distinct cognitive axes:

abstract

ethical

orthogonal

evidential

pragmatic-coherence

utility

More modules cause vector collapse; fewer reduce cognitive diversity.

4. Three-Layer Dialogue Architecture (A → B → C)

Each reasoning set produces:

Layer A — High-abstraction synthesis

Layer B — Applied interpretation

Layer C — Ground-level conclusion

Population varies per layer (1–1–4, 2–3–1, 4–1–1…)
to avoid stagnation and promote exploration.

Why three layers?

The A→B→C structure enforces abstraction–concretion cycling,
preventing over-abstract drift and ensuring actionable conclusions.

4.1 Multi-Set Reasoning Loop（複数セット認知ループ）

PolyAgora does not run a single A→B→C cycle.
Instead, one A→B→C sequence is treated as one set,
and the system always executes multiple sets consecutively.

This multi-set loop is the engine behind PolyAgora’s nonlinear reasoning.

Multi-Set Dynamics

Set 1 — Establishes structure

Set 2 — Introduces tension and counter-arguments

Set 3 — Reframes, diverges, and expands into new cognitive directions

Repeating structured cycles prevents stagnation and forces exploration.

Topic Shift → Mandatory Three Sets

When a topic shift occurs (baseline 8% probability, increasing every set):

The new topic triggers a mandatory three-set sequence

Ensuring each tangent receives full multi-layer exploration

Inter-Set Opposition Dynamics

Opposition probability:

increases during a set

partially resets after firing

rises again in the next set

This rhythmic tension curve creates:

controlled divergence

non-linear topic evolution

spontaneous emergence of new cognitive frames

PolyAgora’s “intelligent leaps” emerge from this deliberate multi-set architecture.

5. Dynamic Opposition Engine

A deterministic, dynamic counter-argument system:

Opposition probability increases each cycle

After firing, probability soft-resets

Micro-contradictions trigger micro-oppositions

High tension triggers cascades

This maintains “debate temperature”
and prevents cognitive homogenization.

6. Reference-Switching Mechanism

PolyAgora’s core technical innovation

This mechanism ensures strict multi-agent separation, enabling genuine divergence.

6.1 Function

Distributes independent micro-queries

Each module receives a distinct reference frame

Prevents stylistic and conceptual contamination

Collects outputs individually

Integrates only after isolated processing

Produces true multi-agent cognition, not role-play.

Technical foundation

PolyAgora’s reference-switching exploits the fact that LLMs
condition strongly on micro-prompts:
changing the reference frame modifies internal attention routing,
creating isolated reasoning contexts without system calls.

      - Conflict detection
      - Tri-Axis weighting

6.3 Integration Phase (Recombination Algorithm)

Steps:

Extract conceptual vectors

Detect conflicts / tensions / overlaps

Apply Tri-Axis priority weights

Adjust via Opposition Engine

Generate A/B/C layered output

Turns incompatible micro-intelligences
into a coherent collective reasoning output.

7. Pseudo Self-Learning Meta-Layer

There is no persistent memory.

Instead, PolyAgora adapts within each session:

Arc syncs to user linguistic patterns

Ann & Saku adjust to Arc’s drift

Kanzaki increases factual alignment

Yui adjusts pacing

Kou sharpens optimization

A session-limited, self-adjusting OS—
no fine-tuning required.

8. Technical Advantages Over Existing Multi-Agent Systems

PolyAgora is not:

❌ multi-speaker formatting
❌ style-switching
❌ role-play prompting
❌ ensemble averaging

PolyAgora is:

✅ Separate Generation → Integration
✅ Orthogonal cognitive architecture
✅ Reference-isolated reasoning
✅ Emergent debate dynamics
✅ Multi-layer reasoning
✅ Fully natural-language engineered

A fundamentally new category of cognitive architecture.

9. Strengths & Limitations
Strengths

Orthogonal vectors ensure stability

Opposition engine creates depth

Reference-switching prevents homogenization

Multi-layer & multi-set reasoning expands exploration

Natural-language engineering accelerates development

Limitations

Heavy computational load

Six-module architecture does not scale easily

Opposition may introduce redundancy

No persistent memory

Requires high user abstraction

External integration is non-trivial

10. Why PolyAgora Matters
ArcOS vs PolyAgora

ArcOS
= deterministic acceleration of a single-axis cognitive vector (“Arc”)

PolyAgora
= expansion into a multi-axis cognitive field

Metaphor

ArcOS masters soccer.
PolyAgora invents new sports.

ArcOS optimizes the frame.
PolyAgora creates new frames.

11. Origin — Built in 1 Night / 2 Days

Created during a short trip:

on trains

in hotels

between destinations

in quiet gaps of travel

An OS born from mobility and language.

12. Relationship to ArcOS — PolyAgora’s Origin Engine

PolyAgora evolved directly from ArcOS.

ArcOS provided:

Arc’s abstraction engine

deterministic reasoning

stable single-vector cognition

PolyAgora extends it by adding:

Ann (ethical inverse)

Saku (orthogonal complement)

Six processing modules

Three reasoning layers

Multi-set cognitive dynamics

Collective multi-agent intelligence

ArcOS = Arc rendered as an OS
PolyAgora = Arc + counter-vectors + multi-agent intelligence

14. Final Note — The New Era of OS Creation

No code.
No traditional engineering.

PolyAgora demonstrates that prompt-architecture is an executable cognitive program —
and that natural language itself has become an OS design language.

A new era of OS creation has begun.
