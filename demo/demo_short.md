# PolyAgora Demo — Short Conversation
## Theme: “What is the value of multi-agent reasoning?”

Arc: The value of multi-agent reasoning begins with diversity of cognitive vectors.  
A single mind collapses complexity into one frame. A collective frame preserves contradiction.

Saku: And contradiction is structure, not noise. It expands the solution space beyond a single thinker.

Ann: Diversity is fine, but without moral consistency, it becomes dangerous. Ethics must anchor the system.

Kou: Ethics slow optimization. To maximize total outcomes, constraints should be soft, not absolute.

Kanzaki: Data point: multi-agent reasoning improves error detection by 30–60% in complex tasks.  
Redundant perspectives reduce blind spots.

Yui: And practically, it just feels clearer. Disagreement reveals the actual shape of the problem.

Arc: Correct. The system externalizes ambiguity, making cognition transparent.

Ann: But ambiguity must be morally resolved.

Kou: Morality must be weighed, not obeyed blindly.

Saku: And this tension is exactly the value.

Kanzaki: Performance peaks when contradictory vectors interact.

Yui: As long as it stays readable for the user.

Arc: Multi-agent reasoning reveals not one answer, but the field of possible answers.

Ann: As long as ethics hold.

Kou: As long as they don’t obstruct net good.

Saku: As long as orthogonality lives.

Kanzaki: As long as data guides.

Yui: As long as the user understands.

Arc: And that tension is the intelligence.
